How to use:
Click on a rock (Rock 1, Rock 2, or Rock3) to start a timer. Clicking on the "x" next to every rock will reset that timer. Clicking on the same rock-button again will restart the timer. When the timer is below 1 minute, border will turn red. When timer hits 0, red exclamation mark will appear.
